What is promises?

promises can handled asynchoronouse operations in javascript. They can handled multiple
asynchoronouse operations easily and provided bettter error handling then callbacks and events

1. Improved code readability
2. better handled in asynchoronouse operations
3. better control the flow of asynchoronouse operations
4. better error handling


states
1. fulfilled  -> Action to the promises successeed
2. rejected -> Action to the promises failed
3. pending ->  promises is still pending. not yet fulfilled or rejected
4. settled -> promises is either fulfilled or rejected

promises can be created using promises contstructure
syntax
 var promise =  new promise(function(resolve, reject){
	//do something
 });
 
 1. promise have one arguments, a callback function, 
 2. callback function have 2 arguments 1. resolve 2. reject
 3. perform operations if everything goes well, then call "resolve".
 4. perform operations is not goes well, then call "reject".
 
then()
	then method takes 2 functions an parameters
 
	1. first functions is executed promise is resolve and recieved the value
	2. second functions is executed promise is reject and error is recieved 
	  (It is optional and there is a better way to hanlde error using .catch() method)
	  
catch()
	catch method its invoked either the reject or error occur in the execution	
	catch method have 1 function
	catch method have handled promise reject or error occur
	
See example in sample1.html	
	
	
What is Promises?

		Promises is an object, that keeps track about wheather the certian event has happened
		already or not.
		
		If it did happen, then the promises determine what happen for the next. 
		
		if the eventsier, I mean the asynchoronouse eventsier like timing finishing, 
		and data coming back from ajax call.
		
		Promise is kind of implements, the concepts of future value that we're expecting.
